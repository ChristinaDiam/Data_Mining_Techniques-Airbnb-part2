# Data Mining Techniques (part 2)

In this project we have the same data (as part 1) from the Airbnb app for the region of Athens area for 3 months of 2019 and 2023. The data is in .csv format and is used to analyse, train and test some models and find the similarity and semantic neighborhoods of some words. 

This project consists of 3 parts.  
The first part is **"Study over time"** using **HuggingFace** and *roBERTa-base-sentiment* model to find the sentiment.  
The second part is **"Sentiment Analysis"** using two different methods (Tf-idf and Word embeddings), Training with *10-fold Cross Validation* for **SVM, Random Forests, KNN** models and Testing.  
The third part is **"Cosine Similarity and Semantic neighborhoods"**, the similarity between two given words is computed according to:

1. Maximum similarity of neighborhoods
2. Correlation of neighborhood similarities
3. Sum of squared neighborhood similarities.
